I have developed a responsive sign-in page using React JS, which is designed to be user-friendly and interactive. The sign-in process requires the user to click on
"Create New Account" to sign-up.

Upon signing in 6 digit otp is randomly generated and can be regenerated by clicking on "Resend" after 10 seconds.

The sign-in page features a carousal banner that is interactive and consists of four slides, each with unique content. The user can navigate through the slides by clicking on the left or right arrow buttons, or by radio buttons.

In addition to the carousal banner, I have integrated multiple UI animations throughout the page to enhance the user experience.

To ensure that the sign-in page is accessible and user-friendly on all devices, I have used responsive design techniques and tested the page on a range of screen sizes and devices.
